> **How to use this guide:** Every single fact is a Q/A flashcard. Cover the answer, test yourself. The spacing effect means you'll remember 3x more than passive reading.

---

# PART 1: IMAGING STRATEGY

### Q: What is the PRIMARY modality for esophageal evaluation?
**A:** Fluoroscopy (barium swallow) — for both anatomy AND function.

### Q: When do you use DOUBLE-contrast esophagram?
**A:** Mucosal detail — reflux, plaques, reticular patterns.

### Q: When do you use SINGLE-contrast with WATER-SOLUBLE agent?
**A:** Suspected PERFORATION. Use Gastrografin first (water-soluble), then thin barium if negative.

> 🔴 **TRAP:** Never use barium first if perforation is suspected — barium in the mediastinum = mediastinitis.

### Q: What are the LIMITED roles of CT and MRI in esophageal imaging?
**A:** Cancer staging (CT) and identifying duplication cysts (MRI/CT).

> 🧠 **MEMORY HOOK:** "Barium is the BREAD AND BUTTER. CT is for CANCER. MRI is for CYSTS."

---

# PART 2: ANATOMY — THE FOUNDATION

### Q: What is the A-Ring?
**A:** Muscular ring ABOVE the vestibule. It is DYNAMIC (moves on swallow).

### Q: What is the B-Ring (Schatzki Ring)?
**A:** MUCOSAL ring at the GE junction. It is STATIC (does NOT move).

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**A** = **A**ctive (dynamic). **B** = **B**locked in place (static)."

### Q: What is the Z-Line?
**A:** The squamocolumnar junction. Rarely seen on barium, standard on endoscopy.

### Q: Where is the cricopharyngeus and what does it do?
**A:** Level C5-C6. The TRUE upper esophageal sphincter. Creates a smooth POSTERIOR indentation.

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**C**ricopharyngeus at **C**5-**C**6."

### Q: A mucosal lesion creates what angle with the wall?
**A:** ACUTE angle (sharp). It's FROM the wall.

### Q: A submucosal or extrinsic lesion creates what angle?
**A:** OBTUSE angle (blunt). It pushes the wall from underneath/outside.

> 🧠 **MEMORY HOOK:** "**A**cute = **A**rising from mucosa. **O**btuse = **O**utside/underneath."

---

# PART 3: ACHALASIA

### Q: What is the pathophysiology of achalasia?
**A:** Failure of LES to relax due to destruction of myenteric ganglia (Auerbach plexus).

### Q: What is the classic barium sign of achalasia?
**A:** **"Bird's Beak"** — smooth, tapered distal narrowing.

### Q: What are the two causes of achalasia?
**A:** Idiopathic (most common) or Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi — think South America).

### Q: What are the TWO complications of achalasia?
**A:** 1) Candida esophagitis (from stasis) and 2) Squamous Cell Carcinoma (20-year lag).

> ⚡ **HIGH YIELD:** Achalasia → SCC (not adeno). 20-year lag. This is a classic FMH2 trap.

### Q: What does achalasia look like on barium?
**A:** Massively dilated esophagus, debris ("cheerios and mashed potatoes"), ABSENT primary peristalsis, bird's beak distally.

### Q: What does achalasia look like on CT?
**A:** Massively dilated, fluid/debris-filled esophagus. No air in stomach (because LES won't open).

### Q: What is pseudoachalasia?
**A:** Cancer at the GEJ mimicking achalasia. Key difference: does NOT relax with standing. Fixed obstruction.

> 🔴 **TRAP:** True achalasia CAN show transient LES relaxation on standing. Pseudoachalasia CANNOT. If it's fixed → think cancer.

### Q: What is "Vigorous Achalasia"?
**A:** Early form with repetitive simultaneous NON-propulsive contractions. The esophagus isn't dilated yet.

### Q: What are the 3 treatments for achalasia?
**A:** Pneumatic dilation, Heller myotomy, POEM (peroral endoscopic myotomy).

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**P**OP the bird's beak: **P**neumatic, **O**perative (Heller), **P**OEM."

---

# PART 4: SCLERODERMA

### Q: What percentage of scleroderma patients have esophageal involvement?
**A:** **80%** — the esophagus is the most commonly affected GI organ.

### Q: What is the pathophysiology of scleroderma esophagus?
**A:** Smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis of the DISTAL 2/3.

> ⚡ **HIGH YIELD:** Why distal 2/3? Because the UPPER 1/3 is striated muscle (unaffected). Scleroderma attacks SMOOTH muscle only.

### Q: What is the classic sign of scleroderma esophagus?
**A:** **"Patulous" LES** — permanently open, incompetent sphincter.

### Q: What lung pattern is associated with scleroderma?
**A:** **NSIP** — basal-predominant lung fibrosis.

### Q: What esophageal complication does scleroderma cause?
**A:** Free reflux → Barrett's esophagus (because the LES is wide open).

### Q: Scleroderma vs Achalasia — how do you tell them apart?
**A:**
| | Scleroderma | Achalasia |
|---|---|---|
| **LES** | OPEN (patulous) | CLOSED (bird's beak) |
| **Reflux** | YES (free) | NO |
| **Stomach air** | YES | NO |

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**S**cleroderma = **S**phincter is **S**lack. **A**chalasia = **A**ll shut."

### Q: Can esophageal dilation appear before skin changes in scleroderma?
**A:** YES — the esophagus can be the first clue.

---

# PART 5: REFLUX & BARRETT'S

### Q: What are the risk factors for reflux esophagitis?
**A:** Chronic GERD, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (excess acid).

### Q: What does reflux look like on barium?
**A:** Fold thickening, mucosal granularity, DISTAL strictures.

### Q: What is the classic barium sign of Barrett's?
**A:** **Reticular mucosal pattern** (lace-like).

### Q: Where are Barrett's strictures located?
**A:** **MID-esophageal** (HIGH stricture), associated with a hiatal hernia.

> ⚡ **HIGH YIELD:** Why mid-esophageal? Barrett's metaplastic tissue is ACID-RESISTANT. The acid damages the normal squamous tissue ABOVE Barrett's → stricture forms at the junction.

### Q: Barrett's is a precursor to which cancer?
**A:** **Adenocarcinoma** (NOT squamous cell).

> 🧠 **MEMORY HOOK:** "**B**arrett's → **B**ottom of esophagus → **A**denocarcinoma. **A**chalasia → **A**nywhere → **S**quamous."

### Q: What can reflux esophagitis cause structurally?
**A:** Esophageal shortening → hiatal hernia formation.

---

# PART 6: INFECTIOUS ESOPHAGITIS

### Q: What is the classic appearance of Candida esophagitis?
**A:** **"Shaggy" contour** with discrete plaque-like lesions.

### Q: In what clinical context does Candida esophagitis occur?
**A:** HIV, transplant recipients, or ACHALASIA (stasis).

### Q: What is the classic appearance of Herpes esophagitis?
**A:** Small, discrete, well-defined ulcers with a **halo of edema** around each. Scattered randomly.

### Q: What is the classic appearance of CMV esophagitis?
**A:** **Large, flat, ovoid** ulcers (giant ulcers). Often fewer in number but bigger.

> ⚡ **HIGH YIELD COMPARISON:**
> | Infection | Ulcer Size | Ulcer Shape | Keyword |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | **Candida** | Plaques (not true ulcers) | Linear/irregular | **SHAGGY** |
> | **Herpes** | Small | Discrete, round + halo | **VOLCANO** |
> | **CMV** | Large | Flat, ovoid | **GIANT** |

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**C**andida = **C**ottage cheese (shaggy). **H**erpes = **H**alo. CM**V** = **V**ery large."

### Q: What mimics Candida on imaging but is benign?
**A:** **Glycogenic acanthosis** — small mucosal nodules in asymptomatic elderly patients. NOT infectious.

# PART 7: DIVERTICULA

### Q: Where is Zenker's diverticulum and which direction does it go?
**A:** Hypopharynx (ABOVE cricopharyngeus). Goes POSTERIORLY. Through Killian's dehiscence.

### Q: Where is Killian-Jamieson diverticulum?
**A:** Cervical esophagus (BELOW cricopharyngeus). Goes ANTEROLATERAL. Often bilateral.

> 🔴 **TRAP:** Zenker = ABOVE CP, posterior. Killian-Jamieson = BELOW CP, anterolateral. Examiners LOVE this distinction.

### Q: What is a traction diverticulum?
**A:** Mid-esophageal, TRIANGULAR shape. Caused by scarring from TB or sarcoidosis (mediastinal lymph nodes pull on the wall).

### Q: What is an epiphrenic diverticulum?
**A:** Distal esophagus (above diaphragm). Associated with motor disorders (achalasia, DES).

### Q: What is pseudodiverticulosis?
**A:** Multiple tiny out-pouchings from dilated SUBMUCOSAL GLANDS. Associated with reflux and strictures.

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC for diverticula (top to bottom):**
> "**Z**enker (top, posterior) → **K**illian-Jamieson (cervical, anterolateral) → **T**raction (mid, triangular) → **E**piphrenic (bottom, motor)."
> First letters: **Z-K-T-E** = "**Z**apper **K**ills **T**he **E**sophagus"

> 🧠 **CLASSIC MNEMONIC:** "**Z**enker is in the **back** (Z is at the back of the alphabet)."

---

# PART 8: ESOPHAGEAL CANCER

### Q: Where does Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) occur?
**A:** MID to UPPER esophagus.

### Q: What are the risk factors for SCC?
**A:** Smoking, Alcohol, Lye (caustic) ingestion, Achalasia (20-year lag).

### Q: Where does Adenocarcinoma occur?
**A:** DISTAL 1/3 (near GEJ).

### Q: What are the risk factors for Adenocarcinoma?
**A:** Barrett's esophagus, Chronic reflux.

> ⚡ **HIGH YIELD TABLE:**

> | **Risk** | Smoke, Alcohol, Lye, Achalasia | Barrett's, Reflux |
> | **Buzzword** | "Abrupt shoulders" | Reticular pattern (precursor) |

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**S**CC = **S**moking/**S**pirits (alcohol), upper. **A**deno = **A**cid (reflux), bottom."

### Q: What does esophageal cancer look like on barium?
**A:** Irregular contour, "apple-core" stricture, or polypoid mass.

### Q: What is the critical staging transition on CT?
**A:** **T3 vs T4.** T3 = adventitia (resectable). T4 = invasion of spine/aorta/heart (unresectable).

### Q: What is the primary role of PET/CT?
**A:** Identifying **Stage IV disease** (distant metastases) → these patients are NOT surgical candidates.

### Q: What is varicoid carcinoma?
**A:** Submucosal tumor spread that mimics varices. Key difference: does NOT change shape with peristalsis or Valsalva.

> 🔴 **TRAP:** Varices change shape. Varicoid carcinoma does NOT. If "varices" are fixed → think cancer.

---

# PART 9: MOTILITY DISORDERS

### Q: What causes a "Corkscrew Esophagus"?
**A:** **Diffuse Esophageal Spasm (DES)** — repetitive, simultaneous, NON-propulsive contractions.

### Q: What are tertiary waves?
**A:** Non-propulsive waves in the elderly. Called "presbyesophagus." Common and usually incidental.

### Q: How is Nutcracker Esophagus diagnosed?
**A:** High-resolution manometry showing pressures **>180 mmHg**. Barium is NORMAL. Manometry is required.

> 🔴 **TRAP:** Nutcracker esophagus looks NORMAL on barium. Only manometry makes the diagnosis.

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**C**orkscrew = **C**ontractions you can SEE. **N**utcracker = **N**ormal barium, need manometry."

---

# PART 10: RINGS, WEBS & STRUCTURAL

### Q: What diameter defines a pathologic Schatzki ring?
**A:** **<13 mm**. Above 13 mm = usually asymptomatic.

### Q: What is Schatzki ring associated with?

### Q: What is an esophageal web?
**A:** Thin ANTERIOR infolding, usually cervical.

### Q: What syndrome is associated with esophageal webs?
**A:** **Plummer-Vinson Syndrome** = iron-deficiency anemia + cervical web + dysphagia.

> ⚡ **HIGH YIELD:** Plummer-Vinson increases risk of postcricoid SCC.

### Q: What is "Feline Esophagus"?
**A:** Transient, fine TRANSVERSE folds in the lower 2/3. Associated with reflux. Named because it looks like a cat's esophagus.

### Q: What are "Uphill" varices?
**A:** Portal hypertension → blood flows UP through esophageal veins. Varices in the BOTTOM half.

### Q: What are "Downhill" varices?
**A:** SVC obstruction → blood flows DOWN. Varices in the TOP half.

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**Up**hill varices = blood going **up** from portal system = **bottom** of esophagus. **Down**hill = blood coming **down** from SVC = **top** of esophagus."

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**Shatz-B-ki Ring**" involves the **B**-ring.

# PART 11: CONGENITAL & PEDIATRIC

### Q: What is the classic X-ray sign of esophageal atresia?
**A:** NG tube CURLS in the upper esophageal pouch — it cannot pass distally.

### Q: What association must you look for with esophageal atresia?
**A:** **VACTERL:** Vertebral, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheo-Esophageal, Renal, Limb anomalies.

### Q: What is an H-type TE fistula?
**A:** Tracheo-esophageal fistula WITHOUT atresia. Excessive air in the stomach. Diagnosis often DELAYED because the baby can still swallow.

### Q: What is the most common SYMPTOMATIC vascular ring?
**A:** **Double aortic arch.**

### Q: What causes Dysphagia Lusoria?
**A:** **Aberrant right subclavian artery** — crosses behind the esophagus, causing a posterior impression.

### Q: A coin in the esophagus is oriented how on AP X-ray?
**A:** **CORONAL** (en face / flat on AP view).

### Q: A coin in the trachea is oriented how?
**A:** **SAGITTAL** (on edge on AP view) because tracheal rings are C-shaped (incomplete posteriorly).

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "The esophagus is a FLAT pocket → coin lies FLAT (coronal). The trachea is a TUBE with a gap → coin turns SIDEWAYS (sagittal)."

---

# PART 12: BENIGN MASSES

### Q: What is the most common benign esophageal tumor?
**A:** **Leiomyoma.** Smooth, round submucosal filling defect. Sharp margins, obtuse angles.

### Q: Are GISTs common in the esophagus?
**A:** NO — GISTs are rare in the esophagus (most common in the stomach).

### Q: What is a fibrovascular polyp?
**A:** Pedunculated mass containing FAT. Can be regurgitated into the MOUTH (risk of asphyxiation).

> 🔴 **TRAP:** If you see fat in an esophageal mass → think fibrovascular polyp. This is pathognomonic.

### Q: Where are esophageal duplication cysts located?
**A:** **Posterior mediastinum**, abutting the esophagus. Water-density on CT. Does NOT communicate with the lumen.

# PART 13: THE DILATED ESOPHAGUS — MASTER DIFFERENTIAL

> ⚡ **ULTRA HIGH YIELD — This table wins exam points:**

### Q: Dilated esophagus + Bird's Beak (closed LES) + no stomach air?
**A:** **ACHALASIA.**

### Q: Dilated esophagus + Open LES + free reflux + lung fibrosis?
**A:** **SCLERODERMA.**

### Q: Dilated esophagus + Fixed obstruction at GEJ + older patient?
**A:** **PSEUDOACHALASIA** (cancer).

| | Achalasia | Scleroderma | Pseudoachalasia |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Peristalsis** | Absent | Absent (distal 2/3) | Absent |
| **LES** | Bird's Beak (CLOSED) | Patulous (OPEN) | Fixed mass |
| **Stomach Air** | NO | YES | Variable |
| **Reflux** | NO | YES (free) | NO |
| **Key Clue** | Candida risk | NSIP lungs | GEJ mass, older age |

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**A**chalasia = **A**ll closed. **S**cleroderma = **S**phincter is slack. **P**seudoachalasia = **P**ick up the mass."

---

# PART 14: MISSING HIGH-YIELD TOPICS (Not in original summary)

> ⚡ These are FMH2-testable and were absent from the NotebookLM summary:

### Q: What is caustic (lye) ingestion stricture?
**A:** Long segment stricture, usually mid-esophagus. Increases risk of SCC (10-30 year lag).

### Q: What is pill esophagitis?
**A:** Focal ulceration at points of anatomical narrowing (aortic arch, left atrium). Common culprits: doxycycline, alendronate, potassium chloride, NSAIDs.

### Q: What is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)?
**A:** Young male with dysphagia and food impaction. Barium shows: RINGED esophagus ("trachealization"), small-caliber esophagus, or strictures. Multiple biopsies needed (>15 eosinophils/HPF).

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "EoE = **E**asy **o**n **E**verything but solids (food impaction in young males)."

### Q: What is Boerhaave syndrome?
**A:** Spontaneous esophageal perforation (usually left posterolateral distal esophagus) after forceful vomiting. CT shows: pneumomediastinum, left pleural effusion, esophageal wall discontinuity.

### Q: What is Mallory-Weiss tear?
**A:** Mucosal tear at GEJ from retching. Causes upper GI bleeding. Usually heals spontaneously. Confined to mucosa (unlike Boerhaave = full thickness).

> 🧠 **MNEMONIC:** "**M**allory-Weiss = **M**ucosal (partial). **B**oerhaave = **B**urst (full thickness)."
